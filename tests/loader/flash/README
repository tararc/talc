This is the first revision of the Flash webserver, serving as the
baseline for all of the updates to follow.  The implementation advances
and progresses in the subdirectories ver2, ver3, etc.  This version
contains the following features:

- retrieval of files relative to the current directory (that flash
  was run in), or following symlinks elsewhere in the filesystem.
- memory mapped files
- byte-aligned output (I think)

It does not contain the features:

- CGI processing (and thus no persistent CGI processes)
- pathname translation caching
- response header caching
- file caching
- memory residence testing

This is no longer the most up-to-date version (that is, this whole
source tree).  I'm now keeping a separate CVS for this stuff elsewhere,
so as not to clutter up the talc source tree.  I'd remove this altogether
but the directories are stuck here anyway.
