SPTC version 0.1

Based on PTC available at http://www.gaffer.org/ptc

SPTC (simple ptc) provides a minimal graphics interface to Popcorn
code on Windows NT.  To see how minimal read the documentation in
sptc.h.

This library is a wrapper around the more general ptc library.
Therefore for your code to run, ptc.dll must be in your path.  Linux
versions of ptc are also available, so it should be easy to get all
this working under Linux if anybody wants to take a stab at it.

To use sptc, you must first build the popcorn-in-popcorn compiler,
since that is the only compiler we have that adheres to C's calling
convention.  You must then "make all" in the sptc directory. This
builds the tal interface file sptc.tali, and sptc.obj.

After writing your program, foo.pop, using the interface in sptc.h,
simply call "make foo.exe" to generate an executable.  The makefile is
convenient because it automatically links in sptc.obj and ptc.lib.

You can try the demo fire.pop to make sure everything is working by
trying "make fire.exe".

Good luck, and have fun.
