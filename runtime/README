The TALC runtime consists of the garbage collector, a startup
function, some utilities, and some special array functions.  These are
split across three files: {lib,}gc.{a,lib}, tal_start.c, and
tal_util.tal.

Two interfaces control how .tal files see the runtime.  tal.tali
defines the stuff provided by the runtime, and tal_prog.tali defines
what a .tal program should provide to link to the startup module.

The file tal.inc is included by all .tal files and sets MASM up to do
what we want.

Finally, some data representation assumptions are documented in
representation.doc.

Standard Libraries
------------------

The files stdlib.* provide a standard library that provides some O/S,
I/O, and int<->string conversion utilities.

Popcorn Runtime
---------------

Popcorn has its own additional runtime files, pop_runtime.*.

Cyclone Runtime
---------------

Cyclone has its own special files: cyclone.inc to be included by files
that use cyclone stuff, and cylonelib.c that contains the
implementation of the cyclone macros.

Loader Runtime
--------------

Support for dynamic linking is provided as a primitive that
loads in closed object files that export a particular function.  This
interface is not yet finished.
