How to Release TALC
===================

1) Tagging the files.  With CVSROOT set to where the repository is,
run the command cvs rtag release-x_x talc/<filename> for the files to
be released.  Currently I do:

cvs rtag release-x_x talc/Makefile talc/README talc/INSTALL talc/util \
                     talc/computil talc/talx86 talc/popcorn talc/scheme \
                     talc/build talc/runtime talc/stripm \
		     talc/doc/tal.el talc/doc/TODO talc/doc/CHANGES 
                     talc/doc/talx86_lang_spec.tex talc/doc/proof.sty \
                     talc/toplevel talc/apps talc/tests

2) Export the sources.  Goto \\bigbird\til\talc\releases and run the
command:

cvs export -rrelease-x_x -d talc-x.x talc
cd talc-x.x
touch .depend

Check that the directory build exists, if not make it.  Check that the
directory apps/popcorn/build exists, if not make it.

3) Update the files INSTALL & README to reflect the new release number
and check that they are uptodate (people are lazy about this,
releasers should not be).

4) Check that it builds.  I would suggest:

make depend
make clean all runtime scheme_runtime
make PROFILE=y clean all runtime scheme_runtime
make NATIVE=y clean all runtime scheme_runtime

5) Check that the test files work.  I would suggest:

tests/popcorn:
  make all                            (the diff at end should produce no ouput)
  make USETALC=y all                  (ditto)

apps/popcorn:
  make all scheme_linkcheck
  make clean

tests/scheme:
  scheme --TALC *.s    (These tests actually fail, but do them anyway)
  scheme --TALC *.ss

6) If either step (4) or (5) fails then start again.  That is, delete
the exported files, remove the tags (cvs rtag -rrelease-x_x -d
release-x_x talc), checkout the release as a working copy, fix the
problems, commit the changes, release the working copy (cvs release
<working dir>), delete the working copy, start again from (1).

7) Clean the repository:

for i in util computil talx86 runtime toplevel popcorn scheme cfg regalloc; \
  do (cd $i; rm -f *.cmo *.cmi *.cmx *.obj *.o *~ *.output *.exe) \
done
(cd build; rm -f *.cma *.cmxa *.lib)
rm -f talx86/tallex.ml talx86/talparser.ml talx86/talparser.mli \
      popcorn/poplex.ml popcorn/popparse.ml popcorn/popparse.mli \
      toplevel/lineno.ml \
      scheme/slex.ml scheme/sparse.ml scheme/sparse.mli *~
(cd tests/popcorn; make clean)
(cd tests/scheme; rm -f *.obj *.o *.lst *.exe *~)
(cd tests/talx86; rm -f *.obj *.o *.lst *.exe *~)
(cd doc; rm -f *.aux *.dvi *.log *.elc)

8) Create a zip file.  I use WinZip to do this.  Create a new archive
in the parent directory of talc-x.x.  Add with wildcards the files
talc-x.x\*.*.  Turn on store extra folder info and recursive into
folders, turn off store lowercase filenames (this is in the options
menu stuff somewhere).

9) Copy the zip file somewhere, like into the web page directories.

Currently the releases are stored in \\bigbird\til\releases\talc-x.x
and \\bigbird\til\talc\releases\talc-x.x.zip.

10) If these instructions are out of date, then update them.
